# UFOs Sightings

### Overview of Project
Our client Dana, a data journalist has an opportunity to write about UFO’s sighting in her hometown McMinnville, Oregon. To complete the project, she was given a JavaScript file containing UFO’s sighting information that included Countries, states, types of sighting, and a lot of more other information. <br>
However, because of the data magnitude and complexity, she needed an efficient means to manipulate and organize it in a way easier to present the article including the data to her audiences. To assist her, we used JavaScript’s visual functionality (i.e., filters, and highly responsive interfaces) to sift through the data, display the article, created a table of the data to support the findings, and added an easy-to-use filters to fine tune the results. Finally, we tied everything together in an HTML page that will be posted online for the interested parties.

### Results
We used JavaScript, and HTML to handle, manage, and display our findings on an HTML web page. We also employed a CSS (i.e., Cascading Style Sheets) styling method to describe how HTML elements would be displayed on the web page. <br>
This web page consists of a user-friendly interface that contains a feature image, text (e.g., the header, and web page content including the text and image used to communicate Dana’s article) written via HTML and provides a quick access to commands and search criteria built using JavaScript to ensure a dynamic behavior while navigating the page.
