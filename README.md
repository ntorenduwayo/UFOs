# UFOs Sightings

### Overview of Project
Our client Dana, a data journalist has an opportunity to write about UFO’s sighting in her hometown McMinnville, Oregon. To complete the project, she was given a JavaScript file containing UFO’s sighting information that included Countries, states, types of sighting, and a lot of more other information. <br>
However, because of the data magnitude and complexity, she needed an efficient means to manipulate and organize it in a way easier to present the article including the data to her audiences. To assist her, we used JavaScript’s visual functionality (i.e., filters, and highly responsive interfaces) to sift through the data, display the article, created a table of the data to support the findings, and added an easy-to-use filters to fine tune the results. Finally, we tied everything together in an HTML page that will be posted online for the interested parties.

### Results
We used JavaScript, and HTML to handle, manage, and display our findings on an HTML web page. We also employed a CSS (i.e., Cascading Style Sheets) styling method to describe how HTML elements would be displayed on the web page. <br>
This web page consists of a user-friendly interface that contains a feature image, text (e.g., the header, and web page content including the text and image used to communicate Dana’s article) written via HTML and provides a quick access to commands and search criteria built using JavaScript to ensure a dynamic behavior while navigating the page.

##### Commands and Search Criteria:
* UFO Sightings <br>
This command button is located on the upper left corner of the web page and used to reset the page to its default status. Just click on it, and the page will be reset to its default state.

* Search Criteria <br>
This command located on left side of the web page consists of five navigation commands that assist to fine tune the search. These navigation commands prompt a navigator to: <br>
 *Enter a Date,<br>
 *Enter a City,<br>
 *Enter a State,<br>
 *Entera Country,<br>
 *Enter a Shape.

For example, below is how the web page would differ from its default state if we searched for a specific State such as Florida (i.e., fl). Thus, we could look for any information pertaining to the above search commands by just entering a request in any of them and pushing enter on a keyboard.

### Summary
#### 1.	Drawbacks <br>
There are several drawbacks, and one of them is a lack of an intuitive interaction when using the filter search commands:
*	The commands are case sensitive (i.e., when entering anything in the command, it should look exactly as it is in the data table).
*	There is no way of telling the next action (e.g., Hit the enter key on your keyboard to update the page with the results) after entering a request in the search command.
*	There is no information about how to reset the web page to its default state after searching for information.

#### 2.	Recommendations <br>
*	We could improve the web page interface dynamics to be more user friendly by improving the search command to intuitively interact with a user.
*	We could use a live data table to get the most recent UFO sightings.
